    <h4>Is Online Poker Legal in the United States?</h4>
      <p>Despite what you may have heard, playing online poker in the United States is NOT illegal. I repeat, online poker is not federally illegal in the USA.  The only states that have laws making online poker illegal are in Washington and Louisiana (though no individuals have ever been indicted or prosecuted in any US jurisdiction).</p>

      <p>In 2013, a few states officially regulated online poker in the USA. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware were the first states to legalize the game online.  More recently, Pennsylvania and Michigan regulated online poker as well. It's important to note that if you play on these sites you will only be playing against players in those states. If you wish to play online poker with players from other parts of the world you will need to play on sites like Bovada, Intertops, BetOnline, and Blackchip Poker.  All of these sites have a long history of being reliable and fair and in many ways are better than the regulated state by state poker sites.</p>  


      <h4>Which Online Poker Site is Best for Me?</h4>

      <p>The best site to play on is going to be different for every person.  Some things to consider when choosing an online poker room are the type of games you like to play, the software quality, and the size of the player pool. </p>


      <h4>Which sites have the fastest cashouts?</h4>

      <p>All of the sites that we suggest here have a history of fast cashouts.  It is very rare for a poker cashout to ever take more than 2-7 business days on any of the sites that we promote.  Keep in mind that using Bitcoin to withdrawal is going to be faster than any other method available. </p>


      <h4>Why Sign Up with SafeOnlineBets.com?</h4>

      <p>Many poker affiliates suggest playing on sites that have a less than stellar reputation. Please do not fall victim to this.  We have been in the industry for a long time and know which sites are safe to play on and have reliable cashouts.  Unfortunately, a few years back some affiliates were signing up players to Lock Poker and Full Flush Poker.  Both of these sites ended up being ponzi schemes and stealing the players' funds. We ourselves fell victim to these sites so we created SafeOnlineBets.com so that you can be sure that your bets are safe.  We want to make players aware of any sites that are not acting ethically.  If you ever have an issue with a site please contact us directly and we will do everything we can to help and get the word out to others.</p>
