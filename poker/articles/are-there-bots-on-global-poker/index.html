        <p>In today's online poker environment one of the biggest worries for players is if they are playing against a real player or a bot.  I fear that there COULD be a botting issue on Global Poker.</p>

        <p>I have played a million+ hands on Global Poker (I don't have an exact number because they do not allow tracking software) from small stakes 50NL all the way up to 2000NL.  What I find weird in my entire time playing on the site is that I have never been contacted by Global Poker about bots that they have found.  I have seen a few players I suspected being bots suddenly disappear after playing non stop.  I am writing this in hopes to get a little transparency from the site.</p>

        <p>Since we are not allowed to use HUDs on Global Poker, the players are unable to track players.  While it is nice not having HUDs because it creates a good environment for recreational players, it does create an obvious problem that we are unable to use data to find bots.</p>

        <p>On other sites, the players have almost always been the ones to bring botting to light because the site has no incentive to do so. </p>

        <p>If you look up poker botting websites, you will find that each of the botting sites promote Global Poker as a site with a low risk for getting caught. A LOW RISK!  This is worrisome for obvious reasons. </p>

        <p>Again, because we can not use HUDs on this site, it is impossible for me to bring data forward to help prove the issue.</p>

        <p>There's two things that could be happening and both are troubling to me:</p>

        <p>1) Global Poker is doing nothing about bots or don't have the resources to catch them.<br />
          2) They do catch bots but they don't tell the players about them.  </p>

          <p>While both of these things are scary, I do think number two is more likely. I'm sure the company has ways to find bots, most likely they have a team doing this.  I'm sure they ban them constantly.  If that's the case, what is being done with the funds?  I have never talked to any player on the site that has been issued a refund because of botting.  Are the funds being pocketed to the company?  I find it hard to believe that if bots have been found, I would not have been refunded something considering I am probably a top 10 volume player on the site. 
          </p>

        <p>This article isn't meant to put down Global Poker.  From my experience they are a very good site for US players.  However, I am writing this to get their attention and hopefully encourage them to be more transparent going forward.  If you play on Global Poker or any online poker site, please share this article.  The only way we will be able to get transparency going forward is to put pressure on the sites themselves.
