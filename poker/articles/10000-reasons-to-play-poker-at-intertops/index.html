        <p>We get asked over and over again where the best place to play online poker is.  It's not a simple answer because there are so many options and the best online poker room is going to be different for every person.  However, so many players don't take advantage of Intertops Poker that we have no problem saying that it is the most underutilized site.</p>

        <p>Besides having the best rakeback offer for players, they host a Sunday $110 tournament with a guaranteed prize pool of $10,000.  This may not seem like a huge tournament compared to some of the massive tournaments on Blackchip Poker or Bovada.  But, this tournament almost always overlays!  Let me repeat that, this tournament almost overlays.  If you don't know what overlay is, it just means that the number of players entering into the tournament does not add up to the money needed to fulfill the prize pool guarantee.  In this case Intertops needs 100 entries to reach it's $10,000 prize pool. </p>

        <h4>How Much Overlay Does the Tournament Get?</h4>
          
        <p>The Sunday Sundowner regularly overlays between 10%-25% of the guaranteed prize pool.  We have not found another tournament that overlays that much on the internet.  This is basically free money if you play this tournament.</p>

        <h4>Competiton</h4>

        <p>If you have never played on Intertops Poker then you will have to see for yourself, but the competition tends to be more recreational players than pros.  Professionals avoid the site because the tournaments aren't big enough for them, but they are making a big mistake by doing so.  First place in this tournament is usually $2800-$3200 depending on how many entries it gets.  Because the field size is so small you will be able to win, or at least make the final table much more often than on a site with bigger tournaments.  </p>

        <h4>Is Intertops Trustworthy?</h4>

        <p>YES!  Intertops started taking online bets in the 90s and was one of the first to do so.  They have a track record of being one of the best sites in terms of fairness, cashouts, and customer support for taking online bets.  </p>

        <p>Even if you're only going to play the Sundowner on Sunday's at Intertops, it is worth signing up today. This tournament alone is worthwhile for anyone who enjoys playing tournament poker. </p>

        <p>If you sign up through Safe Online Bets you will get 36% Rakeback and a deposit bonus up to $1,000.</p>
